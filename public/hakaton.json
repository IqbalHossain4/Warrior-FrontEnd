      "description": "Gaps in healthcare still exist and the need for better solutions to bridge those gaps is critical. Today, more than half of the world’s population lives one to two hours away from a doctor. The pandemic taught us that telehealth can be a great option. It allows patients and doctors to maintain routine contact and, therefore, good health—but only if the right tools are available. The challenge faced by health providers is how to incorporate new technologies that enable doctors and patients to have real conversations, supported by a simple experience."

        "description": "As smart devices become more accessible to the public and with the rise of fitness and wellness apps available, patients are owning and tracking their own health data in ways that were not accessible to doctors before. Therefore, the need to create secure ways to share data with healthcare providers and connect to their health networks and systems is becoming increasingly important.Patients are collecting data on their eating habits, fitness regimes, and if they have smart medical devices (such as Continuous Glucose Monitoring devices), this data can be shared with their healthcare providers. Enabling patients to share this information with their doctors could facilitate fewer visits, customized treatment plans, and reduce the need for testing in some cases, while giving doctors a better picture to diagnose and customize treatment based on lifestyle."
